Manufacturing-Analytics-Dashboard

Objective / Problem Statement To provide real-time visibility into manufacturing performance by tracking production output, rejection rates, wastage, and employee/machine efficiency, enabling data-driven quality improvement.

📊 Dataset Description Production dataset containing:

Daily manufactured, processed, and rejected quantities Wastage data Employee-wise and machine-wise rejection counts Quarterly production figures Product code-wise rejection details

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI (Data modeling, DAX, dashboard design), Excel (Data cleaning & preprocessing), Tableau((Data cleaning & preprocessing), SQL

🔍 Key Tasks Performed

Data cleaning & transformation for reporting consistency Created KPIs for manufacture, rejected, processed, and wastage quantities Built employee-wise, machine-wise, and product code rejection analysis Designed interactive visuals with slicers for product category and quarter filtering Developed production comparison and manufacture vs. rejected trends

👨‍💻 My Role / Contribution

Led full-cycle dashboard development from data cleaning to visualization Designed KPI cards, bar charts, pie charts, and funnel analysis Implemented dynamic slicers for interactive filtering

💡 Business Recommendations

Investigate top rejection sources (employees/machines) to reduce defects Optimize production processes to minimize wastage Monitor product codes MC027 & MC026 for targeted quality checks Maintain quarterly output stability while improving rejection rates
